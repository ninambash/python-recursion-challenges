'''
Write a function called pretty_print that accepts a complex dictionary and prints out all of it's keys and all of its values. 
The dictionary can have dictionaries nested inside of it.

HOW TO:

Make the function accept two parameters: pretty_print(dictionary, indent).
* dictionary is the dictionary that's currently being iterated over.
* indent is a string representing the current level of indentation.

Whenever you make a recursive call increase the level of indentation by adding two spaces to indent:

It's useful to know how to detect if an object is an instance of a specific class in Python. 
Use the isinstance method to see if a value is an instance of a certain class.

Examples:

dicts:
o1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
o2 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": {"name": "Bruce Wayne", "occupation": "Hero"}, "d": 4}

pretty_print(o1, "")
a: 1
b: 2

pretty_print(o2, "")
a: 1
b: 2
c:
  name: Bruce Wayne
  occupation: Hero
d: 4

# use these for testing

def pretty_print(dictionary, indent):
    for key, value in dictionary.items():
        print(indent + str(key) + ":", end=" ")
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            print()
            pretty_print(value, indent + "  ")
        else:
            print(value)

o1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
o2 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": {"name": "Bruce Wayne", "occupation": "Hero"}, "d": 4}
o3 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": {"name": "Bruce Wayne", "occupation": "Hero", "friends": {"spiderman": {"name": "Peter Parker"}, "superman": {"name": "Clark Kent"}}}, "d": 4}

pretty_print(o1, "")
pretty_print(o2, "")
pretty_print(o3, "")
